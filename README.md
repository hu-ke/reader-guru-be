# Introduction
This project is an **OpenAI-powered** website that integrated with OpenAI's capabilities of text **summarization** and **question answer generation** with given context. Both `.pdf` and `.epub` formats are supported. Summaries and conversations can be mangaged locally. This website is used for **Free**, without having to signup or signin. This repo is the source code of the **server side**. [visit website>>](http://reader.guru/introduction)
# Tech Stack
- [Front side](https://github.com/hu-ke/reader-guru-fe/)
    - Reactjs v18、dexie v4、Typescript v5
- Server side

# Work flow
Each **summarizing** or **Q&A** process may takes few minutes mainly based on your file size as well as OpenAI model's processing efficiency. It's necessary for us to have a grasp of what's going on under the hood. Below is a diagram for the work flow.

1. Before we start, you need to prepare a .pdf or .epub file. If you don't have one, just [click here to download a sample pdf book](https://hukepublicbucket.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/readerguru/IntoThinAirBook.pdf). After uploading, server will take care of everything and you just need to wait. If you are not a developer, just ignore the following time-consuming steps.
2. Server will extract the whole texts from the book uploaded and use proper *Text Splitter* to split the texts into pieces of document.
3. `Embeddings` generated by utilizing [OpenAI embedding](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings).
4. `Vectors` are created by `Pinecone` or `Embedding`
5. Server will return answers or summary depending on user actions.
